a day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the pequod.
not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. captain
peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
look-out upon the hands: bildad did all the purchasing and providing
at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
working till long after night-fall.

on the day following queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at
all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their chests
must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon
the vessel might be sailing. so queequeg and i got down our traps,
resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. but it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
for several days. but no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the pequod
was fully equipped.

every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
indispensable to the business of housekeeping. just so with whaling,
which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,
far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. and
though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
to the same extent as with whalemen. for besides the great length of the
whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors
usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling
vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of
the voyage most depends. hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare
lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare captain
and duplicate ship.

at the period of our arrival at the island, the heaviest storage of the
pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
fuel, and iron hoops and staves. but, as before hinted, for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
ends of things, both large and small.

chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain
bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the pequod, after once
fairly getting to sea. at one time she would come on board with a jar
of pickles for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of quills
for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a
roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. never did
any woman better deserve her name, which was charity--aunt charity, as
everybody called her. and like a sister of charity did this charitable
aunt charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand
and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and
consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars.

but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on
board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
a still longer whaling lance in the other. nor was bildad himself nor
captain peleg at all backward. as for bildad, he carried about with him
a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. every once in a
while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then
concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.

during these days of preparation, queequeg and i often visited the
craft, and as often i asked about captain ahab, and how he was, and when
he was going to come on board his ship. to these questions they would
answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard
every day; meantime, the two captains, peleg and bildad, could attend
to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. if i had been
downright honest with myself, i would have seen very plainly in my heart
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.
but when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be
already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his
suspicions even from himself. and much this way it was with me. i said
nothing, and tried to think nothing.

at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail. so next morning, queequeg and i took a very early start.



chapter 21. going aboard.


it was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
drew nigh the wharf.

"there are some sailors running ahead there, if i see right," said i to
queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, i guess; come on!"

"avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
strangely peering from queequeg to me. it was elijah.

"going aboard?"

"hands off, will you," said i.

"lookee here," said queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

"ain't going aboard, then?"

"yes, we are," said i, "but what business is that of yours? do you know,
mr. elijah, that i consider you a little impertinent?"

"no, no, no; i wasn't aware of that," said elijah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to queequeg, with the most unaccountable
glances.

"elijah," said i, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. we
are going to the indian and pacific oceans, and would prefer not to be
detained."

"ye be, be ye? coming back afore breakfast?"

"he's cracked, queequeg," said i, "come on."

"holloa!" cried stationary elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
paces.

"never mind him," said i, "queequeg, come on."

but he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, said--"did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while ago?"

struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, i answered, saying, "yes,
i thought i did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure."

"very dim, very dim," said elijah. "morning to ye."

once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, "see if you can find 'em now, will ye?

"find who?"

"morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off. "oh! i
was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all one,
all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? good-bye to
ye. shan't see ye again very soon, i guess; unless it's before the grand
jury." and with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for
the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

at last, stepping on board the pequod, we found everything in profound
quiet, not a soul moving. the cabin entrance was locked within; the
hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. going forward
to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. seeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket. he was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. the profoundest slumber
slept upon him.

"those sailors we saw, queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said i,
looking dubiously at the sleeper. but it seemed that, when on the wharf,
queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to; hence i would
have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,
were it not for elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. but i beat the
thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to queequeg
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish
himself accordingly. he put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though
feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly
down there.

"gracious! queequeg, don't sit there," said i.

"oh! perry dood seat," said queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt him
face."

"face!" said i, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off, queequeg, you
are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor. get off, queequeg! look,
he'll twitch you off soon. i wonder he don't wake."

queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. i sat at the feet. we kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper, from one to the other. meanwhile, upon questioning him
in his broken fashion, queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some
of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay
them round in the piers and alcoves. besides, it was very convenient on
an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible
into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps
in some damp marshy place.

while narrating these things, every time queequeg received the tomahawk
from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.

"what's that for, queequeg?"

"perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!"

he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. the
strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began
to tell upon him. he breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
rubbed his eyes.

"holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"

"shipped men," answered i, "when does she sail?"

"aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? she sails to-day. the captain
came aboard last night."

"what captain?--ahab?"

"who but him indeed?"

i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck.

"holloa! starbuck's astir," said the rigger. "he's a lively chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, i must turn to." and so
saying he went on deck, and we followed.

it was now clear sunrise. soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board. meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin.



chapter 22. merry christmas.


at length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers,
and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
ever-thoughtful charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last
gift--a night-cap for stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a
spare bible for the steward--after all this, the two captains, peleg
and bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, peleg
said:

"now, mr. starbuck, are you sure everything is right? captain ahab is
all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
well, call all hands, then. muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"

"no need of profane words, however great the hurry, peleg," said bildad,
"but away with thee, friend starbuck, and do our bidding."

how now! here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, captain
peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the
quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
well as to all appearances in port. and, as for captain ahab, no sign of
him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. but then,
the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. indeed, as that was
not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not
yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, captain ahab stayed
below. and all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant
service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,
having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they
quit the ship for good with the pilot.

but there was not much chance to think over the matter, for captain
peleg was now all alive. he seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding, and not bildad.

"aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered at
the main-mast. "mr. starbuck, drive'em aft."

"strike the tent there!"--was the next order. as i hinted before, this
whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

"man the capstan! blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command, and
the crew sprang for the handspikes.

now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the ship. and here bildad, who, with peleg, be it
known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
order to save the nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
in, for he never piloted any other craft--bildad, i say, might now
be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching
anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,
to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of
a chorus about the girls in booble alley, with hearty good will.
nevertheless, not three days previous, bildad had told them that no
profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod, particularly in
getting under weigh; and charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of watts in each seaman's berth.

meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, captain peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner. i almost thought he would
sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily i paused
on my handspike, and told queequeg to do the same, thinking of the
perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilot. i was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious
bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and
seventy-seventh lay; when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and
turning round, was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. that was my first
kick.

"is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
"spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! why don't ye
spring, i say, all of ye--spring! quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
whiskers; spring there, scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. spring, i
say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!" and so saying, he moved
along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. thinks i,
captain peleg must have been drinking something to-day.

at last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. it
was a short, cold christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. the long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
the bows.

lank bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost
all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady
notes were heard,--

"sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, stand dressed in living green.
so to the jews old canaan stood, while jordan rolled between."


never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. they
were full of hope and fruition. spite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads
and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

at last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed
no longer. the stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

it was curious and not unpleasing, how peleg and bildad were affected at
this juncture, especially captain bildad. for loath to depart, yet;
very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyage--beyond both stormy capes; a ship in which some thousands of
his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,--poor old bildad
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
bounded by the far-off unseen eastern continents; looked towards
the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere
and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
"nevertheless, friend peleg, i can stand it; yes, i can."

as for peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
came too near. and he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck--now
a word below, and now a word with starbuck, the chief mate.

but, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
about him,--"captain bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go. back the
main-yard there! boat ahoy! stand by to come close alongside, now!
careful, careful!--come, bildad, boy--say your last. luck to ye,
starbuck--luck to ye, mr. stubb--luck to ye, mr. flask--good-bye and
good luck to ye all--and this day three years i'll have a hot supper
smoking for ye in old nantucket. hurrah and away!"

"god bless ye, and have ye in his holy keeping, men," murmured old
bildad, almost incoherently. "i hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
be careful in the hunt, ye mates. don't stave the boats needlessly,
ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
within the year. don't forget your prayers, either. mr. starbuck, mind
that cooper don't waste the spare staves. oh! the sail-needles are in
the green locker! don't whale it too much a' lord's days, men; but don't
miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting heaven's good gifts. have an
eye to the molasses tierce, mr. stubb; it was a little leaky, i thought.
if ye touch at the islands, mr. flask, beware of fornication. good-bye,
good-bye! don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold, mr.
starbuck; it'll spoil. be careful with the butter--twenty cents the
pound it was, and mind ye, if--"

"come, come, captain bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,
peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.

ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
atlantic.



chapter 23. the lee shore.


some chapters back, one bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner, encountered in new bedford at the inn.

when on that shivering winter's night, the pequod thrust her vindictive
bows into the cold malicious waves, who should i see standing at her
helm but bulkington! i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years' dangerous
voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term. the land seemed scorching to his feet. wonderfullest
things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this
six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington. let me only say
that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably
drives along the leeward land. the port would fain give succor; the port
is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm
blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. but in that gale,
the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all
hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make
her shudder through and through. with all her might she crowds all sail
off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would
blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again;
for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her
bitterest foe!

know ye now, bulkington? glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while
the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
treacherous, slavish shore?

but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
indefinite as god--so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!
for worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! terrors of
the terrible! is all this agony so vain? take heart, take heart,
o bulkington! bear thee grimly, demigod! up from the spray of thy
ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!



chapter 24. the advocate.


as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, i
am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done
to us hunters of whales.

in the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. if a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials s.w.f. (sperm
whale fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.

doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements. butchers we are, that is
true. but butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour. and
as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall
soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,
and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship
at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. but even
granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery
decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies'
plaudits? and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit
of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran
who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the
apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air
over his head. for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared
with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god!

but, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round
the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!

but look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.

why did the dutch in de witt's time have admirals of their whaling
fleets? why did louis xvi. of france, at his own personal expense, fit
out whaling ships from dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of nantucket? why did
britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
upwards of l1,000,000? and lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our
harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. how comes all this, if
there be not something puissant in whaling?

but this is not the half; look again.

i freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in
one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. one way
and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
well be regarded as that egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
pregnant from her womb. it would be a hopeless, endless task to
catalogue all these things. let a handful suffice. for many years past
the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known parts of the earth. she has explored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart, where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed. if
american and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
harbors, let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the
whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
between them and the savages. they may celebrate as they will the heroes
of exploring expeditions, your cooks, your krusensterns; but i say that
scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket, that were
as great, and greater than your cook and your krusenstern. for in their
succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin
wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would
not willingly have dared. all that is made such a flourish of in the old
south sea voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of
our heroic nantucketers. often, adventures which vancouver dedicates
three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
ship's common log. ah, the world! oh, the world!

until the whale fishery rounded cape horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between europe and
the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast.
it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the
spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it
might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the
liberation of peru, chili, and bolivia from the yoke of old spain, and
the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.

that great america on the other side of the sphere, australia, was given
to the enlightened world by the whaleman. after its first blunder-born
discovery by a dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores
as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. the
whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. moreover,
in the infancy of the first australian settlement, the emigrants were
several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. the uncounted
isles of all polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage
to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the
merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their
first destinations. if that double-bolted land, japan, is ever to become
hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;
for already she is on the threshold.

but if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am i ready to
shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
every time.

the whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
will say.

the whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? who wrote
the first account of our leviathan? who but mighty job! and who composed
the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? who, but no less a prince than
alfred the great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
other, the norwegian whale-hunter of those times! and who pronounced our
glowing eulogy in parliament? who, but edmund burke!

true enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
good blood in their veins.

no good blood in their veins? they have something better than royal
blood there. the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel;
afterwards, by marriage, mary folger, one of the old settlers
of nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and
harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble benjamin--this day darting the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable.

whaling not respectable? whaling is imperial! by old english statutory
law, the whale is declared "a royal fish."*

oh, that's only nominal! the whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way.

the whale never figured in any grand imposing way? in one of the mighty
triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world's capital,
the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the syrian coast, were
the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*


*see subsequent chapters for something more on this head.


grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
dignity in whaling.

no dignity in whaling? the dignity of our calling the very heavens
attest. cetus is a constellation in the south! no more! drive down your
hat in presence of the czar, and take it off to queequeg! no more! i
know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
whales. i account that man more honourable than that great captain of
antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.

and, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered
prime thing in me; if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if
hereafter i shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or
more properly my creditors, find any precious mss. in my desk, then here
i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling; for a
whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard.



chapter 25. postscript.


in behalf of the dignity of whaling, i would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts. but after embattling his facts, an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might
tell eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
blameworthy?

it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
gone through. there is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there
may be a castor of state. how they use the salt, precisely--who knows?
certain i am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his
coronation, even as a head of salad. can it be, though, that they
anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint
machinery? much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential
dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but
meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably
smells of that anointing. in truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil,
unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him
somewhere. as a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.

but the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil is
used at coronations? certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil,
nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. what
then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted
state, the sweetest of all oils?

think of that, ye loyal britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
queens with coronation stuff!



chapter 26. knights and squires.


the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck, a native of nantucket, and a
quaker by descent. he was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
as twice-baked biscuit. transported to the indies, his live blood would
not spoil like bottled ale. he must have been born in some time of
general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous. only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. but this, his
thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and
cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. it was merely
the condensation of the man. he was by no means ill-looking; quite the
contrary. his pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped
up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
egyptian, this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come,
and to endure always, as now; for be it polar snow or torrid sun, like
a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well
in all climates. looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet
lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted
through life. a staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a
telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. yet, for
all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities
in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to
overbalance all the rest. uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and
endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his
life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that
sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to
spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. outward portents
and inward presentiments were his. and if at times these things bent the
welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
of his young cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the
original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those
latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush
of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fishery. "i will have no man in my boat," said
starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale." by this, he seemed to mean,
not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises
from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.

"aye, aye," said stubb, the second mate, "starbuck, there, is as careful
a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery." but we shall ere long
see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a man like
stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.

starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all
mortally practical occasions. besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this
business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of
the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.
wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor
for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting
him. for, thought starbuck, i am here in this critical ocean to kill
whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that
hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew. what doom was
his own father's? where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn
limbs of his brother?

with memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this starbuck which
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. but
it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
confinement, and burn all his courage up. and brave as he might be, it
was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and
mighty man.

but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
abasement of poor starbuck's fortitude, scarce might i have the heart to
write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
the fall of valour in the soul. men may seem detestable as joint
stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
costliest robes. that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves,
so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of
a valor-ruined man. nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. but this
august dignity i treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but
that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. thou shalt see it
shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic
dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from god; himself! the
great god absolute! the centre and circumference of all democracy! his
omnipresence, our divine equality!

if, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, i shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if i shall touch
that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if i shall spread a rainbow
over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear
me out in it, thou just spirit of equality, which hast spread one royal
mantle of humanity over all my kind! bear me out in it, thou great
democratic god! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, bunyan, the
pale, poetic pearl; thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves
of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes; thou who
didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! thou who, in all
thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest thy selectest champions from
the kingly commons; bear me out in it, o god!



chapter 27. knights and squires.


stubb was the second mate. he was a native of cape cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called a cape-cod-man. a happy-go-lucky;
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
for the year. good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
crew all invited guests. he was as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the
snugness of his box. when close to the whale, in the very death-lock of
the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as
a whistling tinker his hammer. he would hum over his old rigadig tunes
while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. long usage had,
for this stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. what he
thought of death itself, there is no telling. whether he ever thought of
it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his
mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed
the order, and not sooner.

what, perhaps, with other things, made stubb such an easy-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
thing must have been his pipe. for, like his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. you would
almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
nose as without his pipe. he kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he
turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
readiness anew. for, when stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.

i say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of
the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, stubb's tobacco
smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.

the third mate was flask, a native of tisbury, in martha's vineyard. a
short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. so utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. this
ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
three years' voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
that length of time. as a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. little flask
was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. they
called him king-post on board of the pequod; because, in form, he could
be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in arctic
whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted
into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those
battering seas.

now these three mates--starbuck, stubb, and flask, were momentous
men. they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
pequod's boats as headsmen. in that grand order of battle in which
captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,
these three headsmen were as captains of companies. or, being armed with
their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;
even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.

and since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a gothic
knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when
the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
down who the pequod's harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
them belonged.

first of all was queequeg, whom starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
for his squire. but queequeg is already known.

next was tashtego, an unmixed indian from gay head, the most westerly
promontory of martha's vineyard, where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring
island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. in the
fishery, they usually go by the generic name of gay-headers. tashtego's
long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding
eyes--for an indian, oriental in their largeness, but antarctic in their
glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest
of the great new england moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal
forests of the main. but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild
beasts of the woodland, tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the
infallible arrow of the sires. to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe
snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
the earlier puritans, and half-believed this wild indian to be a son
of the prince of the powers of the air. tashtego was stubb the second
mate's squire.

third among the harpooneers was daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an ahasuerus to behold. suspended
from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
them. in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. and never having been
anywhere in the world but in africa, nantucket, and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
feet five in his socks. there was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
beg truce of a fortress. curious to tell, this imperial negro, ahasuerus
daggoo, was the squire of little flask, who looked like a chess-man
beside him. as for the residue of the pequod's company, be it said, that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the american whale fishery, are americans born, though
pretty nearly all the officers are. herein it is the same with the
american whale fishery as with the american army and military and
merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction
of the american canals and railroads. the same, i say, because in all
these cases the native american liberally provides the brains, the rest
of the world as generously supplying the muscles. no small number of
these whaling seamen belong to the azores, where the outward bound
nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy
peasants of those rocky shores. in like manner, the greenland whalers
sailing out of hull or london, put in at the shetland islands, to
receive the full complement of their crew. upon the passage homewards,
they drop them there again. how it is, there is no telling, but
islanders seem to make the best whalemen. they were nearly all islanders
in the pequod, isolatoes too, i call such, not acknowledging the common
continent of men, but each isolato living on a separate continent of his
own. yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these isolatoes were!
an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all
the ends of the earth, accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the
world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever
come back. black little pip--he never did--oh, no! he went before. poor
alabama boy! on the grim pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him,
beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for,
to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and
beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!



chapter 28. ahab.


for several days after leaving nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
of captain ahab. the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they
but commanded vicariously. yes, their supreme lord and dictator was
there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate
into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.

every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below, i instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
sea, became almost a perturbation. this was strangely heightened
at times by the ragged elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me, with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived
of. but poorly could i withstand them, much as in other moods i was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
prophet of the wharves. but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness--to call it so--which i felt, yet whenever i came to look
about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions. for though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
acquainted with, still i ascribed this--and rightly ascribed it--to the
fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation
in which i had so abandonedly embarked. but it was especially the aspect
of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most
forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce
confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. three
better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
could not readily be found, and they were every one of them americans; a
nantucketer, a vineyarder, a cape man. now, it being christmas when the
ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting polar weather,
though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every
degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that
merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. it was one
of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the
transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as i
mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as i
levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
reality outran apprehension; captain ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.

there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
recovery from any. he looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. his
whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
unalterable mould, like cellini's cast perseus. threading its way out
from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,
you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. it resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of
a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top
to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly
alive, but branded. whether that mark was born with him, or whether it
was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.
by some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was
made to it, especially by the mates. but once tashtego's senior, an old
gay-head indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till
he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded, and
then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in
an elemental strife at sea. yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
negatived, by what a grey manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
who, having never before sailed out of nantucket, had never ere this
laid eye upon wild ahab. nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old manxman with
preternatural powers of discernment. so that no white sailor seriously
contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should
be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would
find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.

so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me, and the livid
brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments i hardly noted
that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
white leg upon which he partly stood. it had previously come to me that
this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of
the sperm whale's jaw. "aye, he was dismasted off japan," said the old
gay-head indian once; "but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
mast without coming home for it. he has a quiver of 'em."

i was struck with the singular posture he maintained. upon each side of
the pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank.
his bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a
shroud; captain ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the
ship's ever-pitching prow. there was an infinity of firmest fortitude,
a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
forward dedication of that glance. not a word he spoke; nor did his
officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures
and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,
consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. and not only that,
but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his
face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.

ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
but after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
heavily walking the deck. as the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as
if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. and, by and by, it
came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,
he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. but the pequod was
only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the
loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.

nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from
his mood. for, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, april and may,
trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest,
most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green
sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so ahab did, in the
end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. more
than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any
other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.



chapter 29. enter ahab; to him, stubb.


some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the pequod now
went rolling through the bright quito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic.
the warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days,
were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet, heaped up--flaked up, with
rose-water snow. the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
absent conquering earls, the golden helmeted suns! for sleeping man,
'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.
but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new
spells and potencies to the outward world. inward they turned upon the
soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory
shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.
and all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on ahab's
texture.

old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death. among sea-commanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
night-cloaked deck. it was so with ahab; only that now, of late, he
seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. "it feels
like going down into one's tomb,"--he would mutter to himself--"for an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-dug berth."

so, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man
would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.
some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,
he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his
wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such
would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that
their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. but once,
the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,
lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,
stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if captain ahab was
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might
be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and
hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the
ivory heel. ah! stubb, thou didst not know ahab then.

"am i a cannon-ball, stubb," said ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me that
fashion? but go thy ways; i had forgot. below to thy nightly grave;
where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
last.--down, dog, and kennel!"

starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man, stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, "i
am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; i do but less than half like
it, sir."

"avast! gritted ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

"no, sir; not yet," said stubb, emboldened, "i will not tamely be called
a dog, sir."

"then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
or i'll clear the world of thee!"

as he said this, ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
his aspect, that stubb involuntarily retreated.

"i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
muttered stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. "it's
very queer. stop, stubb; somehow, now, i don't well know whether to go
back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my knees and pray
for him? yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
first time i ever did pray. it's queer; very queer; and he's queer too;
aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the queerest old man stubb ever
sailed with. how he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he
mad? anyway there's something on his mind, as sure as there must be
something on a deck when it cracks. he aint in his bed now, either, more
than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. didn't
that dough-boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds
the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets
down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the
pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
it? a hot old man! i guess he's got what some folks ashore call
a conscience; it's a kind of tic-dolly-row they say--worse nor a
toothache. well, well; i don't know what it is, but the lord keep me
from catching it. he's full of riddles; i wonder what he goes into the
after hold for, every night, as dough-boy tells me he suspects; what's
that for, i should like to know? who's made appointments with him in
the hold? ain't that queer, now? but there's no telling, it's the old
game--here goes for a snooze. damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be
born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. and now that i think
of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of
queer, too. damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. but
that's against my principles. think not, is my eleventh commandment; and
sleep when you can, is my twelfth--so here goes again. but how's that?
didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and
piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! he might as well have kicked
me, and done with it. maybe he did kick me, and i didn't observe it,
i was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. it flashed like a
bleached bone. what the devil's the matter with me? i don't stand right
on my legs. coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong
side out. by the lord, i must have been dreaming, though--how? how?
how?--but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again;
and in the morning, i'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by
daylight."



chapter 30. the pipe.


when stubb had departed, ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor
of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the
weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

in old norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. how could one
look at ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking
him of the royalty it symbolized? for a khan of the plank, and a king of
the sea, and a great lord of leviathans was ahab.

some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. "how
now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this smoking no
longer soothes. oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
gone! here have i been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring--aye, and
ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
strongest and fullest of trouble. what business have i with this pipe?
this thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapours
among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. i'll
smoke no more--"

he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. the fire hissed in the
waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
made. with slouched hat, ahab lurchingly paced the planks.



chapter 31. queen mab.


next morning stubb accosted flask.

"such a queer dream, king-post, i never had. you know the old man's
ivory leg, well i dreamed he kicked me with it; and when i tried to kick
back, upon my soul, my little man, i kicked my leg right off! and then,
presto! ahab seemed a pyramid, and i, like a blazing fool, kept kicking
at it. but what was still more curious, flask--you know how curious all
dreams are--through all this rage that i was in, i somehow seemed to be
thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
kick from ahab. 'why,' thinks i, 'what's the row? it's not a real leg,
only a false leg.' and there's a mighty difference between a living
thump and a dead thump. that's what makes a blow from the hand, flask,
fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. the living
member--that makes the living insult, my little man. and thinks i to
myself all the while, mind, while i was stubbing my silly toes against
that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all
the while, i say, i was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but
a cane--a whalebone cane. yes,' thinks i, 'it was only a playful
cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base
kick. besides,' thinks i, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot
part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer
kicked me, there's a devilish broad insult. but this insult is whittled
down to a point only.' but now comes the greatest joke of the
dream, flask. while i was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
shoulders, and slews me round. 'what are you 'bout?' says he. slid! man,
but i was frightened. such a phiz! but, somehow, next moment i was over
the fright. 'what am i about?' says i at last. 'and what business is
that of yours, i should like to know, mr. humpback? do you want a kick?'
by the lord, flask, i had no sooner said that, than he turned round his
stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a
clout--what do you think, i saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern
was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. says i, on second
thoughts, 'i guess i won't kick you, old fellow.' 'wise stubb,' said he,
'wise stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of
his own gums like a chimney hag. seeing he wasn't going to stop saying
over his 'wise stubb, wise stubb,' i thought i might as well fall to
kicking the pyramid again. but i had only just lifted my foot for it,
when he roared out, 'stop that kicking!' 'halloa,' says i, 'what's
the matter now, old fellow?' 'look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue
the insult. captain ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'yes, he did,' says
i--'right here it was.' 'very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg,
didn't he?' 'yes, he did,' says i. 'well then,' says he, 'wise stubb,
what have you to complain of? didn't he kick with right good will? it
wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? no, you were
kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, stubb. it's an
honour; i consider it an honour. listen, wise stubb. in old england the
greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made
garter-knights of; but, be your boast, stubb, that ye were kicked by
old ahab, and made a wise man of. remember what i say; be kicked by him;
account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can't
help yourself, wise stubb. don't you see that pyramid?' with that, he
all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into
the air. i snored; rolled over; and there i was in my hammock! now, what
do you think of that dream, flask?"

"i don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"

"may be; may be. but it's made a wise man of me, flask. d'ye see ahab
standing there, sideways looking over the stern? well, the best thing
you can do, flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
whatever he says. halloa! what's that he shouts? hark!"

"mast-head, there! look sharp, all of ye! there are whales hereabouts!

"if ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!

"what do you think of that now, flask? ain't there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh? a white whale--did ye mark that, man?
look ye--there's something special in the wind. stand by for it, flask.
ahab has that that's bloody on his mind. but, mum; he comes this way."



chapter 32. cetology.


already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
in its unshored, harbourless immensities. ere that come to pass; ere the
pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more
special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to
follow.

it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
that i would now fain put before you. yet is it no easy task. the
classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
essayed. listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

"no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
cetology," says captain scoresby, a.d. 1820.

"it is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the
inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
families.... utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal"
(sperm whale), says surgeon beale, a.d. 1839.

"unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."
"impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea." "a field
strewn with thorns." "all these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists."

thus speak of the whale, the great cuvier, and john hunter, and lesson,
those lights of zoology and anatomy. nevertheless, though of real
knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. many are
the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
large or in little, written of the whale. run over a few:--the authors
of the bible; aristotle; pliny; aldrovandi; sir thomas browne; gesner;
ray; linnaeus; rondeletius; willoughby; green; artedi; sibbald; brisson;
marten; lacepede; bonneterre; desmarest; baron cuvier; frederick cuvier;
john hunter; owen; scoresby; beale; bennett; j. ross browne; the
author of miriam coffin; olmstead; and the rev. t. cheever. but to what
ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited
extracts will show.

of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following owen
ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman. i mean captain scoresby. on the separate
subject of the greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
authority. but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
sperm whale, compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy
mentioning. and here be it said, that the greenland whale is an usurper
upon the throne of the seas. he is not even by any means the largest
of the whales. yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. reference
to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days,
will satisfy you that the greenland whale, without one rival, was to
them the monarch of the seas. but the time has at last come for a new
proclamation. this is charing cross; hear ye! good people all,--the
greenland whale is deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!

there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
succeed in the attempt. those books are beale's and bennett's; both in
their time surgeons to english south-sea whale-ships, and both exact and
reliable men. the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found
in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. as
yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete
in any literature. far above all other hunted whales, his is an
unwritten life.

now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
laborers. as no better man advances to take this matter in hand, i
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. i promise nothing complete;
because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty. i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
description of the various species, or--in this place at least--to much
of any description. my object here is simply to project the draught of a
systematization of cetology. i am the architect, not the builder.

but it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the post-office
is equal to it. to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them;
to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very
pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. what am i that i should
essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! the awful tauntings in job
might well appal me. will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee?
behold the hope of him is vain! but i have swam through libraries and
sailed through oceans; i have had to do with whales with these visible
hands; i am in earnest; and i will try. there are some preliminaries to
settle.

first: the uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of cetology
is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. in his system of
nature, a.d. 1776, linnaeus declares, "i hereby separate the whales from
the fish." but of my own knowledge, i know that down to the year 1850,
sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against linnaeus's express edict,
were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
leviathan.

the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from
the waters, he states as follows: "on account of their warm bilocular
heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex lege naturae jure
meritoque." i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley
coffin, of nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
insufficient. charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

be it known that, waiving all argument, i take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy jonah to back me.
this fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish. above, linnaeus has given
you those items. but in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come? to be short, then, a
whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. there you have
him. however contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation. a walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
fish, because he is amphibious. but the last term of the definition is
still more cogent, as coupled with the first. almost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
vertical, or up-and-down tail. whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
position.

by the above definition of what a whale is, i do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*
hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be
included in this ground-plan of cetology. now, then, come the grand
divisions of the entire whale host.


*i am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled lamatins and
dugongs (pig-fish and sow-fish of the coffins of nantucket) are included
by many naturalists among the whales. but as these pig-fish are a noisy,
contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, i deny their credentials
as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the
kingdom of cetology.


first: according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary
books (subdivisible into chapters), and these shall comprehend them all,
both small and large.

i. the folio whale; ii. the octavo whale; iii. the duodecimo whale.

as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale; of the octavo, the
grampus; of the duodecimo, the porpoise.

folios. among these i here include the following chapters:--i. the sperm
whale; ii. the right whale; iii. the fin-back whale; iv. the hump-backed
whale; v. the razor-back whale; vi. the sulphur-bottom whale.

book i. (folio), chapter i. (sperm whale).--this whale, among the
english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale, and the physeter
whale, and the anvil headed whale, is the present cachalot of the
french, and the pottsfich of the germans, and the macrocephalus of the
long words. he is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being
the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
obtained. all his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
upon. it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do. philologically
considered, it is absurd. some centuries ago, when the sperm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland
or right whale. it was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that
quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of
the word literally expresses. in those times, also, spermaceti was
exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
and medicament. it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays
buy an ounce of rhubarb. when, as i opine, in the course of time, the
true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still
retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so
strangely significant of its scarcity. and so the appellation must at
last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derived.

book i. (folio), chapter ii. (right whale).--in one respect this is the
most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
by man. it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
the oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior article in commerce.
among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
following titles: the whale; the greenland whale; the black whale;
the great whale; the true whale; the right whale. there is a deal of
obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously
baptised. what then is the whale, which i include in the second species
of my folios? it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists; the
greenland whale of the english whalemen; the baliene ordinaire of the
french whalemen; the growlands walfish of the swedes. it is the whale
which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and
english in the arctic seas; it is the whale which the american fishermen
have long pursued in the indian ocean, on the brazil banks, on the nor'
west coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them
right whale cruising grounds.

some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the
english and the right whale of the americans. but they precisely agree
in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. it is by
endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. the
right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference
to elucidating the sperm whale.

book i. (folio), chapter iii. (fin-back).--under this head i reckon
a monster which, by the various names of fin-back, tall-spout, and
long-john, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
atlantic, in the new york packet-tracks. in the length he attains, and
in his baleen, the fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. his great lips
present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
of large wrinkles. his grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. this fin is some
three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the
back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. even if
not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated
fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. when
the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,
and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it
somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on
it. on that ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. the fin-back is not
gregarious. he seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. very
shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the
remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet
rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present
pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable
cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. from
having the baleen in his mouth, the fin-back is sometimes included with
the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales,
that is, whales with baleen. of these so called whalebone whales, there
would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little
known. broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched
whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's
names for a few sorts.

in connection with this appellative of "whalebone whales," it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan, founded upon
either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those
marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford
the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached
bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. how
then? the baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other
and more essential particulars. thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. then, this same
humpbacked whale and the greenland whale, each of these has baleen;
but there again the similitude ceases. and it is just the same with the
other parts above mentioned. in various sorts of whales, they form such
irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,
such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general
methodization formed upon such a basis. on this rock every one of the
whale-naturalists has split.

but it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classification. nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
greenland whale. and if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.
what then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in
their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. and this is
the bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can
possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. to proceed.

book i. (folio) chapter iv. (hump-back).--this whale is often seen on
the northern american coast. he has been frequently captured there, and
towed into harbor. he has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you
might call him the elephant and castle whale. at any rate, the popular
name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm
whale also has a hump though a smaller one. his oil is not very
valuable. he has baleen. he is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of them.

book i. (folio), chapter v. (razor-back).--of this whale little is known
but his name. i have seen him at a distance off cape horn. of a retiring
nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. though no coward, he
has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long
sharp ridge. let him go. i know little more of him, nor does anybody
else.

book i. (folio), chapter vi. (sulphur-bottom).--another retiring
gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. he is seldom seen;
at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas,
and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. he is
never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. prodigies are
told of him. adieu, sulphur bottom! i can say nothing more that is true
of ye, nor can the oldest nantucketer.

thus ends book i. (folio), and now begins book ii. (octavo).

octavoes.*--these embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which
present may be numbered:--i., the grampus; ii., the black fish; iii.,
the narwhale; iv., the thrasher; v., the killer.


*why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain.
because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
in figure, yet the bookbinder's quarto volume in its dimensioned form
does not preserve the shape of the folio volume, but the octavo volume
does.


book ii. (octavo), chapter i. (grampus).--though this fish, whose
loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
popularly classed among whales. but possessing all the grand distinctive
features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one.
he is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet
in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. he swims in
herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in
quantity, and pretty good for light. by some fishermen his approach is
regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.

book ii. (octavo), chapter ii. (black fish).--i give the popular
fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, i shall say so,
and suggest another. i do so now, touching the black fish, so-called,
because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. so, call him the
hyena whale, if you please. his voracity is well known, and from the
circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face. this whale
averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. he is found in almost
all latitudes. he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
in swimming, which looks something like a roman nose. when not more
profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena
whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as
some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. though their
blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
thirty gallons of oil.

book ii. (octavo), chapter iii. (narwhale), that is, nostril
whale.--another instance of a curiously named whale, so named i suppose
from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. the
creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. strictly
speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. but it is only
found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. what
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
say. it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for
a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. charley coffin
said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the narwhale, rising to the
surface of the polar sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
horn up, and so breaks through. but you cannot prove either of these
surmises to be correct. my own opinion is, that however this one-sided
horn may really be used by the narwhale--however that may be--it would
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale, the horned whale, and
the unicorn whale. he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism
to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. from certain
cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn
was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison,
and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. it was also
distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the
horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. originally it
was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. black letter tells
me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage, when
queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
of greenwich palace, as his bold ship sailed down the thames; "when sir
martin returned from that voyage," saith black letter, "on bended knees
he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale,
which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor." an irish
author avers that the earl of leicester, on bended knees, did likewise
present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the
unicorn nature.

the narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
his oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and
he is seldom hunted. he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

book ii. (octavo), chapter iv. (killer).--of this whale little is
precisely known to the nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
naturalist. from what i have seen of him at a distance, i should say
that he was about the bigness of a grampus. he is very savage--a sort of
feegee fish. he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip, and
hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. the
killer is never hunted. i never heard what sort of oil he has. exception
might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground
of its indistinctness. for we are all killers, on land and on sea;
bonapartes and sharks included.

book ii. (octavo), chapter v. (thrasher).--this gentleman is famous for
his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. he mounts
the folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
process. still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer. both
are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

thus ends book ii. (octavo), and begins book iii. (duodecimo).

duodecimoes.--these include the smaller whales. i. the huzza porpoise.
ii. the algerine porpoise. iii. the mealy-mouthed porpoise.

to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
feet should be marshalled among whales--a word, which, in the popular
sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. but the creatures set
down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal
tail.

book iii. (duodecimo), chapter 1. (huzza porpoise).--this is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe. the name is of my own
bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
must be done to distinguish them. i call him thus, because he always
swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth-of-july crowd. their
appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. full of fine
spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. they
are the lads that always live before the wind. they are accounted a
lucky omen. if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
gamesomeness is not in ye. a well-fed, plump huzza porpoise will
yield you one good gallon of good oil. but the fine and delicate fluid
extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. it is in request among
jewellers and watchmakers. sailors put it on their hones. porpoise
meat is good eating, you know. it may never have occurred to you that
a porpoise spouts. indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
readily discernible. but the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature.

book iii. (duodecimo), chapter ii. (algerine porpoise).--a pirate. very
savage. he is only found, i think, in the pacific. he is somewhat larger
than the huzza porpoise, but much of the same general make. provoke him,
and he will buckle to a shark. i have lowered for him many times, but
never yet saw him captured.

book iii. (duodecimo), chapter iii. (mealy-mouthed porpoise).--the
largest kind of porpoise; and only found in the pacific, so far as it is
known. the only english name, by which he has hitherto been designated,
is that of the fishers--right-whale porpoise, from the circumstance that
he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio. in shape, he differs
in some degree from the huzza porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. he has
no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail,
and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue. but his mealy-mouth spoils
all. though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable,
yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called
the "bright waist," that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two
separate colours, black above and white below. the white comprises part
of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he
had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. a most mean and
mealy aspect! his oil is much like that of the common porpoise.


beyond the duodecimo, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as
the porpoise is the smallest of the whales. above, you have all the
leviathans of note. but there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an american whaleman, i know by
reputation, but not personally. i shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what i have here but begun. if
any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
he can readily be incorporated into this system, according to his folio,
octavo, or duodecimo magnitude:--the bottle-nose whale; the junk whale;
the pudding-headed whale; the cape whale; the leading whale; the cannon
whale; the scragg whale; the coppered whale; the elephant whale; the
iceberg whale; the quog whale; the blue whale; etc. from icelandic,
dutch, and old english authorities, there might be quoted other lists of
uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. but i omit
them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for
mere sounds, full of leviathanism, but signifying nothing.

finally: it was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
here, and at once, perfected. you cannot but plainly see that i have
kept my word. but i now leave my cetological system standing thus
unfinished, even as the great cathedral of cologne was left, with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. for small
erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. god keep me from ever
completing anything. this whole book is but a draught--nay, but the
draught of a draught. oh, time, strength, cash, and patience!



chapter 33. the specksnyder.


concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.

the large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old dutch fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the specksnyder. literally this word means fat-cutter;
usage, however, in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer. in
those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation
and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
department and all its concerns, the specksnyder or chief harpooneer
reigned supreme. in the british greenland fishery, under the corrupted
title of specksioneer, this old dutch official is still retained, but
his former dignity is sadly abridged. at present he ranks simply
as senior harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more
inferior subalterns. nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,
but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the
command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political
maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from
the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
their social equal.

now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
this--the first lives aft, the last forward. hence, in whale-ships and
merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
so, too, in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the ship. that is to say, they take their meals in the
captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
and in no instance done away. indeed, many are the nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost
as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in
terrorem, or otherwise; yet even captain ahab was by no means
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.

nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
legitimately intended to subserve. that certain sultanism of his brain,
which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through
those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
dictatorship. for be a man's intellectual superiority what it will,
it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,
without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always,
in themselves, more or less paltry and base. this it is, that for ever
keeps god's true princes of the empire from the world's hustings; and
leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who
become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice
hidden handful of the divine inert, than through their undoubted
superiority over the dead level of the mass. such large virtue lurks
in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
potency. but when, as in the case of nicholas the czar, the ringed crown
of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. nor, will the
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest
sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in
his art, as the one now alluded to.

but ahab, my captain, still moves before me in all his nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching emperors and
kings, i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me. oh, ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
featured in the unbodied air!



chapter 34. the cabin-table.


it is noon; and dough-boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and
master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an
observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the
smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
the upper part of his ivory leg. from his complete inattention to the
tidings, you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial. but
presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to
the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, "dinner, mr.
starbuck," disappears into the cabin.

when the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and starbuck, the
first emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then starbuck
rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after
a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
"dinner, mr. stubb," and descends the scuttle. the second emir lounges
about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to
see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise
takes up the old burden, and with a rapid "dinner, mr. flask," follows
after his predecessors.

but the third emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the grand turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
processions, by bringing up the rear with music. but ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
then, independent, hilarious little flask enters king ahab's presence,
in the character of abjectus, or the slave.

it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of
the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. wherefore this
difference? a problem? perhaps not. to have been belshazzar, king of
babylon; and to have been belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. but he
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man's royalty of
state transcends belshazzar's, for belshazzar was not the greatest. who
has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be caesar. it
is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding. now,
if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.

over his ivory-inlaid table, ahab presided like a mute, maned
sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs. in his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
served. they were as little children before ahab; and yet, in ahab,
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. with one mind,
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he carved
the chief dish before him. i do not suppose that for the world they
would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather. no! and when reaching out his
knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, ahab thereby
motioned starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as
though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started
if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it
noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. for, like
the coronation banquet at frankfort, where the german emperor profoundly
dines with the seven imperial electors, so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old ahab
forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. what a relief it was
to choking stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. and
poor little flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary
family party. his were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have
been the drumsticks. for flask to have presumed to help himself, this
must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. had
he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have
been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
strange to say, ahab never forbade him. and had flask helped himself,
the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it. least of all, did
flask presume to help himself to butter. whether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,
sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for
him, a subaltern; however it was, flask, alas! was a butterless man!

another thing. flask was the last person down at the dinner, and flask
is the first man up. consider! for hereby flask's dinner was badly
jammed in point of time. starbuck and stubb both had the start of him;
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. if stubb
even, who is but a peg higher than flask, happens to have but a small
appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then flask
must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;
for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck.
therefore it was that flask once admitted in private, that ever since he
had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never
known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. for what
he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.
peace and satisfaction, thought flask, have for ever departed from
my stomach. i am an officer; but, how i wish i could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as i used to when i was before the
mast. there's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
there's the insanity of life! besides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask's official
capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,
was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at flask through the cabin
sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab.

now, ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the pequod's cabin. after their departure, taking place in inverted
order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. and then the three
harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.
they made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty
cabin.

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free
license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
the harpooneers. while their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
with such a relish that there was a report to it. they dined like lords;
they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices.
such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego, that to fill out
the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale dough-boy was
fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of
the solid ox. and if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with
a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. and once
daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted dough-boy's memory by
snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher, while tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping him. he was naturally a very nervous,
shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. and what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific ahab, and the periodical tumultuous
visitations of these three savages, dough-boy's whole life was one
continual lip-quiver. commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished
with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into
his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the
blinds of its door, till all was over.

it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego, opposing
his filed teeth to the indian's: crosswise to them, daggoo seated on the
floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
framework to shake, as when an african elephant goes passenger in a
ship. but for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
not to say dainty. it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
baronial, and superb a person. but, doubtless, this noble savage fed
strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. not by
beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. but queequeg, he had a
mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so
much so, that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. and when he would hear
tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. nor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at
all tend to tranquillize poor dough-boy. how could he forget that in his
island days, queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
murderous, convivial indiscretions. alas! dough-boy! hard fares the
white waiter who waits upon cannibals. not a napkin should he carry on
his arm, but a buckler. in good time, though, to his great delight,
the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,
fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every
step, like moorish scimetars in scabbards.

but, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.

in this one matter, ahab seemed no exception to most american whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. so that, in real truth,
the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in it. for when they did enter it, it
was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for
a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
residing in the open air. nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
was no companionship; socially, ahab was inaccessible. though nominally
included in the census of christendom, he was still an alien to it. he
lived in the world, as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled
missouri. and as when spring and summer had departed, that wild logan of
the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter
there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,
ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the
sullen paws of its gloom!



chapter 35. the mast-head.


it was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round.

in most american whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground. and if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial
even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.

now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.
i take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
egyptians; because, in all my researches, i find none prior to them.
for though their progenitors, the builders of babel, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all asia,
or africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread
gale of god's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these babel builders
priority over the egyptians. and that the egyptians were a nation of
mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among
archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical
purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like
formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious
long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount
to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a
modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. in
saint stylites, the famous christian hermit of old times, who built him
a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a
tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs
or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to
the last, literally died at his post. of modern standers-of-mast-heads
we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely
incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange
sight. there is napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of vendome,
stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;
careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether louis philippe, louis
blanc, or louis the devil. great washington, too, stands high aloft on
his towering main-mast in baltimore, and like one of hercules' pillars,
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
will go. admiral nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
mast-head in trafalgar square; and ever when most obscured by that
london smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for
where there is smoke, must be fire. but neither great washington, nor
napoleon, nor nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however
madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks
upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits
penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals
and what rocks must be shunned.

it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy, the sole
historian of nantucket, stands accountable. the worthy obed tells us,
that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty
spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means
of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. a few
years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand,
who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh
the beach. but this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the
one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. the three mast-heads
are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their
regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two
hours. in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. there
you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the
deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and
between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even
as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old
rhodes. there you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with
nothing ruffled but the waves. the tranced ship indolently rolls; the
drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. for the
most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts
of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear
of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for
all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and
your bill of fare is immutable.

in one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
mast-head would amount to several entire months. and it is much to be
deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute
of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. your
most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called
the t' gallant cross-trees. here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner
feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. to be sure,
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of
a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its
fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out
of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim
crossing the snowy alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of
a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. you
cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.

concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits, called crow's-nests, in which the look-outs of a greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. in
the fireside narrative of captain sleet, entitled "a voyage among the
icebergs, in quest of the greenland whale, and incidentally for the
re-discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland;" in
this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with
a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
crow's-nest of the glacier, which was the name of captain sleet's good
craft. he called it the sleet's crow's-nest, in honour of himself; he
being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our
own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so
likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we
may beget. in shape, the sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large
tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with
a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.
being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a
little trap-hatch in the bottom. on the after side, or side next the
stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for
umbrellas, comforters, and coats. in front is a leather rack, in which
to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
conveniences. when captain sleet in person stood his mast-head in this
crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for
the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns
infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from
the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon
them is a very different thing. now, it was plainly a labor of love
for captain sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed
conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many
of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his
experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for
the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
the "local attraction" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to
the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the
glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down
blacksmiths among her crew; i say, that though the captain is very
discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned "binnacle
deviations," "azimuth compass observations," and "approximate errors,"
he knows very well, captain sleet, that he was not so much immersed
in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted
occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely
tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.
though, upon the whole, i greatly admire and even love the brave, the
honest, and learned captain; yet i take it very ill of him that he
should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend
and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
within three or four perches of the pole.

but if we southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
captain sleet and his greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float. for one, i used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
chat with queequeg, or any one else off duty whom i might find there;
then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at
last mount to my ultimate destination.

let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that i kept but
sorry guard. with the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
could i--being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
altitude--how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
whale-ships' standing orders, "keep your weather eye open, and sing out
every time."

and let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
nantucket! beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head. beware
of such an one, i say; your whales must be seen before they can be
killed; and this sunken-eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. nor
are these monitions at all unneeded. for nowadays, the whale-fishery
furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber. childe harold not unfrequently perches
himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and
in moody phrase ejaculates:--

"roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."

very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
"interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwise. but all in vain; those young
platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? they have
left their opera-glasses at home.

"why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've been
cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
yet. whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here."
perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every
strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
continually flitting through it. in this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs
away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like
crammer's sprinkled pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every
shore the round globe over.

there is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
the inscrutable tides of god. but while this sleep, this dream is on ye,
move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity
comes back in horror. over descartian vortices you hover. and perhaps,
at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you
drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise
for ever. heed it well, ye pantheists!



chapter 36. the quarter-deck.


(enter ahab: then, all)


it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
morning shortly after breakfast, ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck. there most sea-captains usually walk at that
hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the
garden.

soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. did
you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints of his one
unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

but on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. and, so full of his
thought was ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
outer movement.

"d'ye mark him, flask?" whispered stubb; "the chick that's in him pecks
the shell. 'twill soon be out."

the hours wore on;--ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

it drew near the close of day. suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with
one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft.

"sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

"send everybody aft," repeated ahab. "mast-heads, there! come down!"

when the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, ahab, after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. with bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men; till stubb cautiously whispered to flask, that ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. but
this did not last long. vehemently pausing, he cried:--

"what do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"

"sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices.

"good!" cried ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them.

"and what do ye next, men?"

"lower away, and after him!"

"and what tune is it ye pull to, men?"

"a dead whale or a stove boat!"

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.

but, they were all eagerness again, as ahab, now half-revolving in his
pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--

"all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale. look ye! d'ye see this spanish ounce of gold?"--holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. d'ye
see it? mr. starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."

while the mate was getting the hammer, ahab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
vitality in him.

receiving the top-maul from starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "whosoever of ye
raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!"

"huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

"it's a white whale, i say," resumed ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
"a white whale. skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
if ye see but a bubble, sing out."

all this while tashtego, daggoo, and queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection.

"captain ahab," said tashtego, "that white whale must be the same that
some call moby dick."

"moby dick?" shouted ahab. "do ye know the white whale then, tash?"

"does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said the
gay-header deliberately.

"and has he a curious spout, too," said daggoo, "very bushy, even for a
parmacetty, and mighty quick, captain ahab?"

"and he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
captain," cried queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
him--him--" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him--"

"corkscrew!" cried ahab, "aye, queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him; aye, daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the
great annual sheep-shearing; aye, tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
split jib in a squall. death and devils! men, it is moby dick ye have
seen--moby dick--moby dick!"

"captain ahab," said starbuck, who, with stubb and flask, had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. "captain
ahab, i have heard of moby dick--but it was not moby dick that took off
thy leg?"

"who told thee that?" cried ahab; then pausing, "aye, starbuck; aye, my
hearties all round; it was moby dick that dismasted me; moby dick that
brought me to this dead stump i stand on now. aye, aye," he shouted with
a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
"aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!" then tossing both arms, with
measureless imprecations he shouted out: "aye, aye! and i'll chase him
round good hope, and round the horn, and round the norway maelstrom, and
round perdition's flames before i give him up. and this is what ye have
shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and
over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.
what say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? i think ye do look
brave."

"aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: "a sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
moby dick!"

"god bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout. "god bless ye,
men. steward! go draw the great measure of grog. but what's this long
face about, mr. starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
game for moby dick?"

"i am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of death too, captain
ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but i
came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. how many barrels
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, captain ahab? it
will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market."

"nantucket market! hoot! but come closer, starbuck; thou requirest
a little lower layer. if money's to be the measurer, man, and the
accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!"

"he smites his chest," whispered stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow."

"vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried starbuck, "that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct! madness! to be enraged with a dumb thing,
captain ahab, seems blasphemous."

"hark ye yet again--the little lower layer. all visible objects, man,
are but as pasteboard masks. but in each event--in the living act, the
undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. if man
will strike, strike through the mask! how can the prisoner reach outside
except by thrusting through the wall? to me, the white whale is that
wall, shoved near to me. sometimes i think there's naught beyond. but
'tis enough. he tasks me; he heaps me; i see in him outrageous strength,
with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. that inscrutable thing is
chiefly what i hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
principal, i will wreak that hate upon him. talk not to me of blasphemy,
man; i'd strike the sun if it insulted me. for could the sun do that,
then could i do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play
herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. but not my master, man,
is even that fair play. who's over me? truth hath no confines. take off
thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish
stare! so, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to
anger-glow. but look ye, starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing
unsays itself. there are men from whom warm words are small indignity. i
meant not to incense thee. let it go. look! see yonder turkish cheeks of
spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. the pagan
leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek,
and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! the crew, man, the
crew! are they not one and all with ahab, in this matter of the whale?
see stubb! he laughs! see yonder chilian! he snorts to think of it.
stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot,
starbuck! and what is it? reckon it. 'tis but to help strike a fin; no
wondrous feat for starbuck. what is it more? from this one poor hunt,
then, the best lance out of all nantucket, surely he will not hang back,
when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? ah! constrainings
seize thee; i see! the billow lifts thee! speak, but speak!--aye, aye!
thy silence, then, that voices thee. (aside) something shot from my
dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. starbuck now is mine;
cannot oppose me now, without rebellion."

"god keep me!--keep us all!" murmured starbuck, lowly.

but in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage;
nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
their hearts sank in. for again starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with
the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds
blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. ah,
ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? but
rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! yet not so much
predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
within. for with little external to constrain us, the innermost
necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

"the measure! the measure!" cried ahab.

receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons. then ranging them before him near
the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates
stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company
formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly
eyeing every man of his crew. but those wild eyes met his, as the
bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere
he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to
fall into the hidden snare of the indian.

"drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman. "the crew alone now drink. round with it, round! short
draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as satan's hoof. so, so; it
goes round excellently. it spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye. well done; almost drained. that way it went, this
way it comes. hand it me--here's a hollow! men, ye seem the years; so
brimming life is gulped and gone. steward, refill!

"attend now, my braves. i have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that i may in some
sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. o men, you
will yet see that--ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. hand
it me. why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, were't not thou st.
vitus' imp--away, thou ague!

"advance, ye mates! cross your lances full before me. well done! let
me touch the axis." so saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
starbuck to stubb; from stubb to flask. it seemed as though, by some
nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic
life. the three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic
aspect. stubb and flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of
starbuck fell downright.

"in vain!" cried ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well. for did ye three but
once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had
perhaps expired from out me. perchance, too, it would have dropped ye
dead. perchance ye need it not. down lances! and now, ye mates, i do
appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there--yon three
most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. disdain
the task? what, when the great pope washes the feet of beggars, using
his tiara for ewer? oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, that
shall bend ye to it. i do not order ye; ye will it. cut your seizings
and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"

silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
up, before him.

"stab me not with that keen steel! cant them; cant them over! know ye
not the goblet end? turn up the socket! so, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
advance. the irons! take them; hold them while i fill!" forthwith,
slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

"now, three to three, ye stand. commend the murderous chalices! bestow
them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. ha!
starbuck! but the deed is done! yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
it. drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
whaleboat's bow--death to moby dick! god hunt us all, if we do not hunt
moby dick to his death!" the long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. starbuck paled, and turned, and
shivered. once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
dispersed; and ahab retired within his cabin.



chapter 37. sunset.


the cabin; by the stern windows; ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.


i leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er i
sail. the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
but first i pass.

yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
the gold brow plumbs the blue. the diver sun--slow dived from noon--goes
down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. is, then,
the crown too heavy that i wear? this iron crown of lombardy. yet is
it bright with many a gem; i the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
darkly feel that i wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'tis iron--that
i know--not gold. 'tis split, too--that i feel; the jagged edge galls
me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

dry heat upon my brow? oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me, so the sunset soothed. no more. this lovely light, it lights not me;
all loveliness is anguish to me, since i can ne'er enjoy. gifted with
the high perception, i lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly
and most malignantly! damned in the midst of paradise! good night--good
night! (waving his hand, he moves from the window.)

'twas not so hard a task. i thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
revolve. or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
stand before me; and i their match. oh, hard! that to fire others, the
match itself must needs be wasting! what i've dared, i've willed; and
what i've willed, i'll do! they think me mad--starbuck does; but i'm
demoniac, i am madness maddened! that wild madness that's only calm
to comprehend itself! the prophecy was that i should be dismembered;
and--aye! i lost this leg. i now prophesy that i will dismember my
dismemberer. now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. that's
more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. i laugh and hoot at ye, ye
cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf burkes and blinded bendigoes!
i will not say as schoolboys do to bullies--take some one of your own
size; don't pommel me! no, ye've knocked me down, and i am up again; but
ye have run and hidden. come forth from behind your cotton bags! i have
no long gun to reach ye. come, ahab's compliments to ye; come and see
if ye can swerve me. swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
yourselves! man has ye there. swerve me? the path to my fixed purpose is
laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. over unsounded
gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds,
unerringly i rush! naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron
way!



chapter 38. dusk.


by the mainmast; starbuck leaning against it.


my soul is more than matched; she's overmanned; and by a madman!
insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! but
he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! i think i see
his impious end; but feel that i must help him to it. will i, nill i,
the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable i have no
knife to cut. horrible old man! who's over him, he cries;--aye, he would
be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! oh! i
plainly see my miserable office,--to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
to hate with touch of pity! for in his eyes i read some lurid woe would
shrivel me up, had i it. yet is there hope. time and tide flow wide.
the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small
gold-fish has its glassy globe. his heaven-insulting purpose, god may
wedge aside. i would up heart, were it not like lead. but my whole
clock's run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, i have no key to
lift again.


[a burst of revelry from the forecastle.]


oh, god! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
mothers in them! whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. the white whale
is their demigorgon. hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward!
mark the unfaltering silence aft! methinks it pictures life. foremost
through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering
bow, but only to drag dark ahab after it, where he broods within his
sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, and further
on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. the long howl thrills me through!
peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! oh, life! 'tis in an hour like
this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,--as wild, untutored
things are forced to feed--oh, life! 'tis now that i do feel the latent
horror in thee! but 'tis not me! that horror's out of me! and with the
soft feeling of the human in me, yet will i try to fight ye, ye grim,
phantom futures! stand by me, hold me, bind me, o ye blessed influences!



chapter 39. first night watch.

fore-top.

(stubb solus, and mending a brace.)


ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--i've been thinking over it
ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence. why so? because a
laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and come what
will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is, it's all
predestinated. i heard not all his talk with starbuck; but to my poor
eye starbuck then looked something as i the other evening felt. be sure
the old mogul has fixed him, too. i twigged it, knew it; had had the
gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when i clapped my eye upon
his skull i saw it. well, stubb, wise stubb--that's my title--well,
stubb, what of it, stubb? here's a carcase. i know not all that may be
coming, but be it what it will, i'll go to it laughing. such a waggish
leering as lurks in all your horribles! i feel funny. fa, la! lirra,

out?--giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, i dare say, gay as
a frigate's pennant, and so am i--fa, la! lirra, skirra! oh--

we'll drink to-night with hearts as light, to love, as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim, and break on the lips while
meeting.


a brave stave that--who calls? mr. starbuck? aye, aye, sir--(aside) he's
my superior, he has his too, if i'm not mistaken.--aye, aye, sir, just
through with this job--coming.



chapter 40. midnight, forecastle.

harpooneers and sailors.

(foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and
lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)

     farewell and adieu to you, spanish ladies!
     farewell and adieu to you, ladies of spain!
     our captain's commanded.--

1st nantucket sailor. oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the
digestion! take a tonic, follow me! (sings, and all follow)

    our captain stood upon the deck,
    a spy-glass in his hand,
    a viewing of those gallant whales
    that blew at every strand.
    oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
    and by your braces stand,
    and we'll have one of those fine whales,
    hand, boys, over hand!
    so, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
    while the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

mate's voice from the quarter-deck. eight bells there, forward!

2nd nantucket sailor. avast the chorus! eight bells there! d'ye hear,
bell-boy? strike the bell eight, thou pip! thou blackling! and let me
call the watch. i've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.
so, so, (thrusts his head down the scuttle,) star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
eight bells there below! tumble up!

dutch sailor. grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. i
mark this in our old mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as
filliping to others. we sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like
ground-tier butts. at 'em again! there, take this copper-pump, and hail
'em through it. tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses. tell 'em
it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.
that's the way--that's it; thy throat ain't spoiled with eating
amsterdam butter.

french sailor. hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to
anchor in blanket bay. what say ye? there comes the other watch. stand
by all legs! pip! little pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

pip. (sulky and sleepy) don't know where it is.

french sailor. beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. jig it, men,
i say; merry's the word; hurrah! damn me, won't you dance? form, now,
indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? throw yourselves! legs!
legs!

iceland sailor. i don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my
taste. i'm used to ice-floors. i'm sorry to throw cold water on the
subject; but excuse me.

maltese sailor. me too; where's your girls? who but a fool would take
his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do? partners! i
must have partners!

sicilian sailor. aye; girls and a green!--then i'll hop with ye; yea,
turn grasshopper!

long-island sailor. well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.
hoe corn when you may, say i. all legs go to harvest soon. ah! here
comes the music; now for it!

azore sailor. (ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)
here you are, pip; and there's the windlass-bitts; up you mount! now,
boys! (the half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some
sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. oaths a-plenty.)

azore sailor. (dancing) go it, pip! bang it, bell-boy! rig it, dig it,
stig it, quig it, bell-boy! make fire-flies; break the jinglers!

pip. jinglers, you say?--there goes another, dropped off; i pound it so.

china sailor. rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
thyself.


french sailor. merry-mad! hold up thy hoop, pip, till i jump through it!
split jibs! tear yourselves!

tashtego. (quietly smoking) that's a white man; he calls that fun:
humph! i save my sweat.

old manx sailor. i wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
they are dancing over. i'll dance over your grave, i will--that's
the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
corners. o christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled
crews! well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you scholars have
it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it. dance on, lads, you're
young; i was once.

3d nantucket sailor. spell oh!--whew! this is worse than pulling after
whales in a calm--give us a whiff, tash.

(they cease dancing, and gather in clusters. meantime the sky
darkens--the wind rises.)

lascar sailor. by brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon. the sky-born,
high-tide ganges turned to wind! thou showest thy black brow, seeva!

maltese sailor. (reclining and shaking his cap.) it's the waves--the
snow's caps turn to jig it now. they'll shake their tassels soon. now
would all the waves were women, then i'd go drown, and chassee with them
evermore! there's naught so sweet on earth--heaven may not match
it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.

sicilian sailor. (reclining.) tell me not of it! hark ye, lad--fleet
interlacings of the limbs--lithe swayings--coyings--flutterings! lip!
heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
else come satiety. eh, pagan? (nudging.)

tahitan sailor. (reclining on a mat.) hail, holy nakedness of our
dancing girls!--the heeva-heeva! ah! low veiled, high palmed tahiti! i
still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! i saw thee woven
in the wood, my mat! green the first day i brought ye thence; now worn
and wilted quite. ah me!--not thou nor i can bear the change! how
then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? hear i the roaring streams from
pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the
villages?--the blast! the blast! up, spine, and meet it! (leaps to his
feet.)

portuguese sailor. how the sea rolls swashing 'gainst the side! stand
by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
they'll go lunging presently.

danish sailor. crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
holdest! well done! the mate there holds ye to it stiffly. he's no more
afraid than the isle fort at cattegat, put there to fight the baltic
with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

4th nantucket sailor. he has his orders, mind ye that. i heard old
ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
waterspout with a pistol--fire your ship right into it!

english sailor. blood! but that old man's a grand old cove! we are the
lads to hunt him up his whale!

all. aye! aye!

old manx sailor. how the three pines shake! pines are the hardest sort
of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none
but the crew's cursed clay. steady, helmsman! steady. this is the sort
of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea.
our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in the
sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

daggoo. what of that? who's afraid of black's afraid of me! i'm quarried
out of it!

pip (shrinking under the windlass). jollies? lord help such jollies!
crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! blang-whang! god! duck lower,
pip, here comes the royal yard! it's worse than being in the whirled
woods, the last day of the year! who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?
but there they go, all cursing, and here i don't. fine prospects to 'em;
they're on the road to heaven. hold on hard! jimmini, what a squall!
but those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white squalls, they.
white squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! here have i heard all their
chat just now, and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken of
once! and only this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my
tambourine--that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him! oh,
thou big white god aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on
this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no
bowels to feel fear!



chapter 41. moby dick.


i, ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger i shouted, and more
did i hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. a
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; ahab's quenchless feud
seemed mine. with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of
violence and revenge.

for some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the sperm whale fishermen. but not all of them knew of his
existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him;
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
him, was small indeed. for, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers;
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along
solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort;
the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the
times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct
and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide
whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby
dick. it was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have
encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,
a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after
doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to
some minds it was not an unfair presumption, i say, that the whale in
question must have been no other than moby dick. yet as of late the
sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
battle to moby dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to
the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large, than to the individual
cause. in that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between ahab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.

and as for those who, previously hearing of the white whale, by chance
caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
whale of that species. but at length, such calamities did ensue in these
assaults--not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or
devouring amputations--but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those
repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors
upon moby dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunters, to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come.

nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. for not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound,
wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. and as the
sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. for not only are whalemen
as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most
directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing
in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but,
hand to jaw, give battle to them. alone, in such remotest waters, that
though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you
would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too
such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.

no wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the white whale did
in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,
and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
that visibly appears. so that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the white
whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
jaw.

but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm
whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. there are
those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale, would
perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest with the sperm whale; at any rate, there are
plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing
under the american flag, who have never hostilely encountered the sperm
whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north; seated on their
hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
and awe, to the wild, strange tales of southern whaling. nor is the
pre-eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more
feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.

and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former
legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists--olassen and povelson--declaring the sperm whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. nor
even down to so late a time as cuvier's, were these or almost similar
impressions effaced. for in his natural history, the baron himself
affirms that at sight of the sperm whale, all fish (sharks included) are
"struck with the most lively terrors," and "often in the precipitancy of
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
cause instantaneous death." and however the general experiences in the
fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness,
even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson, the superstitious belief in
them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of
the hunters.

so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
the fishermen recalled, in reference to moby dick, the earlier days
of the sperm whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the sperm whale was not for mortal man. that to attempt it, would
be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. on this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted.

nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to moby dick; and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered.

one of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,
was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time.

nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability. for as the secrets
of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to
the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the sperm whale
when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his
pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and
contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the
mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.

it is a thing well known to both american and english whale-ships, and
as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby,
that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific, in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland
seas. nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have exceeded very many days. hence, by inference, it has been
believed by some whalemen, that the nor' west passage, so long a problem
to man, was never a problem to the whale. so that here, in the real
living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of
the inland strello mountain in portugal (near whose top there was said
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near
syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land
by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whalemen.

forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the white whale had escaped
alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
go still further in their superstitions; declaring moby dick not only
ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that
though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still
swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would
once more be seen.

but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power. for, it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. these were his prominent
features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

the rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the white whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
gleamings.

nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. more than
all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
else. for, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every
apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn
round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to
splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.

already several fatalities had attended his chase. but though similar
disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual
in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the white whale's
infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
unintelligent agent.

judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

his three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
dashed at the whale, as an arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.
that captain was ahab. and then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, moby dick had reaped away ahab's
leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. no turbaned turk, no
hired venetian or malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.
small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
encounter, ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his
intellectual and spiritual exasperations. the white whale swam before
him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which
some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with
half a heart and half a lung. that intangible malignity which has been
from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds; which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced
in their statue devil;--ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he
pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. all that most maddens and
torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice
in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle
demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy ahab, were visibly
personified, and made practically assailable in moby dick. he piled upon
the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
by his whole race from adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a
mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.

it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. then, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
months of days and weeks, ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one
hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling patagonian cape;
then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;
and so interfusing, made him mad. that it was only then, on the homeward
voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems
all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,
he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital
strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified
by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even
there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. in a strait-jacket, he swung
to the mad rockings of the gales. and, when running into more sufferable
latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the
tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed
left behind him with the cape horn swells, and he came forth from his
dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that
firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once
again; and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone; even
then, ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. human madness is oftentimes a
cunning and most feline thing. when you think it fled, it may have but
become transfigured into some still subtler form. ahab's full lunacy
subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated hudson,
when that noble northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the
highland gorge. but, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of
ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not
one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. that before living
agent, now became the living instrument. if such a furious trope may
stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,
and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far
from having lost his strength, ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
any one reasonable object.

this is much; yet ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
but vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. winding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where
we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your
way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast roman halls of thermes;
where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root
of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! so with a broken
throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a caryatid, he
patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages. wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,
sad king! a family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled
royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old state-secret come.

now, in his heart, ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
are sane, my motive and my object mad. yet without power to kill, or
change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
dissemble; in some sort, did still. but that thing of his dissembling
was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him.

the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause. and so too, all the added moodiness which
always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the
present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. nor is it so very unlikely,
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he
was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. gnawed within and
scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
his underlings to the attack. but be all this as it may, certain it is,
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
him, ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
and all-engrossing object of hunting the white whale. had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the
ship from such a fiendish man! they were bent on profitable cruises, the
profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. he was intent on an
audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.

here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--morally enfeebled
also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
starbuck, the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in flask. such a crew, so officered,
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
to his monomaniac revenge. how it was that they so aboundingly responded
to the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the white whale as much
their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the white
whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon
of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
ishmael can go. the subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
pick? who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? what skiff in tow
of a seventy-four can stand still? for one, i gave myself up to the
abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to
encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest
ill.



chapter 42. the whiteness of the whale.


what the white whale was to ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick, which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, there
was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that i almost despair of
putting it in a comprehensible form. it was the whiteness of the whale
that above all things appalled me. but how can i hope to explain myself
here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself i must, else all
these chapters might be naught.

though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas,
and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a
certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old
kings of pegu placing the title "lord of the white elephants" above all
their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings
of siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard;
and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger;
and the great austrian empire, caesarian, heir to overlording rome,
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this
pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white
man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all
this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among
the romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal
sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many
touching, noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age;
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt
of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes,
whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge,
and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power; by the persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being
held the holiest on the altar; and in the greek mythologies, great jove
himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the
noble iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was
by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful
creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit
with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from
the latin word for white, all christian priests derive the name of
one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the
cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith, white is
specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord; though
in the vision of st. john, white robes are given to the redeemed, and
the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne, and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all
these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable,
and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness
which affrights in blood.

this elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent
horrors they are? that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an
abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb
gloating of their aspect. so that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or
shark.*


*with reference to the polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not
the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds, the polar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrast. but even assuming all this to be true;
yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
terror.

as for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
same quality in the polar quadruped. this peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish. the romish
mass for the dead begins with "requiem eternam" (eternal rest), whence
requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. now,
in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and
the mild deadliness of his habits, the french call him requin.


bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations? not coleridge first threw that spell; but god's great,
unflattering laureate, nature.*


*i remember the first albatross i ever saw. it was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard upon the antarctic seas. from my forenoon watch
below, i ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
main hatches, i saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
with a hooked, roman bill sublime. at intervals, it arched forth
its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. wondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook it. though bodily unharmed, it uttered
cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. through its
inexpressible, strange eyes, methought i peeped to secrets which took
hold of god. as abraham before the angels, i bowed myself; the white
thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
waters, i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
towns. long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage. i cannot tell, can only
hint, the things that darted through me then. but at last i awoke; and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. a goney, he replied. goney!
never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! but some time after, i
learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. so that by no
possibility could coleridge's wild rhyme have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine, when i saw that bird upon our
deck. for neither had i then read the rhyme, nor knew the bird to be
an albatross. yet, in saying this, i do but indirectly burnish a little
brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.

i assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,
that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;
and these i have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when i
beheld the antarctic fowl.

but how had the mystic thing been caught? whisper it not, and i will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
at last the captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and then letting
it escape. but i doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
taken off in heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
the invoking, and adoring cherubim!


most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of
the white steed of the prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. he was the
elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies. at
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light. the flashing cascade of his
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. a
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god,
bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. whether marching amid
his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains, like an ohio; or whether with his
circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the white
steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his
cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the
bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. nor
can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble
horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him
with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.

but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and
albatross.

what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! it
is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name
he bears. the albino is as well made as other men--has no substantive
deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. why should this be so?

nor, in quite other aspects, does nature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces
this crowning attribute of the terrible. from its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white
squall. nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary. how wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction, the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the
market-place!

nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. it
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. and
from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud
in which we wrap them. nor even in our superstitions do we fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a
milk-white fog--yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even
the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his
pallid horse.

therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.

but though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
account for it? to analyse it, would seem impossible. can we, then,
by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek?

let us try. but in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. and
though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
recall them now.

why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with
new-fallen snow? or, to the unread, unsophisticated protestant of the
middle american states, why does the passing mention of a white friar or
a white nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?

or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the white
tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an untravelled american, than those other storied structures, its
neighbors--the byward tower, or even the bloody? and those sublimer
towers, the white mountains of new hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name, while the thought of virginia's blue ridge is full of a soft,
dewy, distant dreaminess? or why, irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes, does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness
over the fancy, while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal
thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by
the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? or, to choose a wholly
unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading
the old fairy tales of central europe, does "the tall pale man" of the
hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the
green of the groves--why is this phantom more terrible than all the
whooping imps of the blocksburg?

nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;--it
is not these things alone which make tearless lima, the strangest,
saddest city thou can'st see. for lima has taken the white veil; and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. old as pizarro,
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.

i know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught
of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost
solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under
any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. what i mean
by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the
following examples.

first: the mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his
ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness--as if from
encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round
him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the
lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go
down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. yet where is
the mariner who will tell thee, "sir, it was not so much the fear of
striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stirred me?"

second: to the native indian of peru, the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. much the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the west, who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance of whiteness. not so the sailor, beholding the
scenery of the antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick
of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
ice monuments and splintered crosses.

but thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but
a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
ishmael.

tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon the
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness--why
will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
of affright? there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
former perils; for what knows he, this new england colt, of the black
bisons of distant oregon?

no; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world. though thousands of miles from
oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
this instant they may be trampling into dust.

thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to ishmael, are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!

though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
those things must exist. though in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
