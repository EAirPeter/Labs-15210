Running the tester of this lab requires Python 2.7 and PIL along with a SML/NJ installation. 
You should also have Python in your PATH.

To test your solution on Windows, open a command prompt at the directory, and run "run".
You should enter a SML/NJ environment.

Input ' use "testing"; ' in the environment to compile your solution and tester. 
Be sure to use testing. Only making sources.cm will NOT compile the tester properly for direct use!

Use Tester.testMST and Tester.testSegmenter as instructed in the pdf file.

The modifications are provided "as-is". There's no guarantee that it will always be correct. 
Also, it will not work with the modified version of Test Suite to give expected results.
